# Credit-Risk-classification: Reporting

## Overview of the Analysis
Within this module, the <ins>purpose</ins> of the excercise was to train and evaluate a supervised machine learning algoright to detect loan credit worthiness. This includes the following methods:

* Financial information was based on the following  target and feature variables:
  * Features: loan_size, interest_rate,borrower_income, debt_to_income ratio, num_of_accoutns and deragotaory_marks
  * Target:  Loan_Status- 1 for High Risk and 0 for Healthy.
* Stages of the machine learning method:
1. Split the data into training and testing sets post variable determination
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with original data
3. 
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
